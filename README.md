# Predictive Autoscaling System

This repository implements a predictive autoscaling system for AWS EC2 using simulated workloads, CloudWatch metrics, and a machine learning model.

## Features
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Automated workload simulation (Bash scripts)
- CloudWatch metrics collection
- ML-based prediction and scaling logic

## Structure
- `/infrastructure` — Terraform
- `/load-scripts` — Bash workload scripts
- `/ml` — Python ML code
